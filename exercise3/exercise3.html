<h3>what is a website?</h3>
<p>I view websites as an ever changing digital space where information can be displayed in endless amounts of styles. I like how they can be simply defined as a file that lives on a server. They can always be updated and change overtime. They can also capture an era of time and freeze it if the website doesn't get updated and years pass.</p>

<h3>my relationship with technology</h3>
<p>My relationship with tech is always changing. I have times where I really enjoy using tech and being online. I am able to find many things online and find new interests and learn about things I don't think I would have come across learning at school. The times where I don't really enjoy technology are times where I feel like I've become overly dependent on it, but it is very challenging to escape that now because of how present it is in my everyday life.</p>

<h3>will websites someday become obsolete?</h3>
<p>I do not think that any time soon in the future that websites will slowly go out of use. Many are constantly updated and even those that do not, act as a digital archive. Our society now is very dependent on finding information online, which can be found on websites.</p>
