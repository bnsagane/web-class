<!--Why I like websites-->
<div class="closing">
<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>I like the example of the macbook on the Apple website because I have always thought Apple had one of the most interesting websites and I have always enjoyed the experience scrolling and seeing how the website transforms. Though I agree it can load slow at times. I thought his perspective was insightful because I would have never thought that the apple website was doing things that a website "shouldn't."</p>
