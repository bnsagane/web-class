    <p>I came into this class not knowing a single thing about coding, so I have definitely learned a lot from taking this class. I feel like I got to learn the most essential parts of coding and what comes with building a website. I also really appreciated how much creative freedom there is so I did not feel like I had to design in a specific way, but rather express in my own way the concepts I learned. I am satisfied with some of my web designs but not all of them of course, I got stumped on design ideas with some exercises and projects so I do not like them as much. I definitely appreciate digital design a lot more now that I see what it takes to make it. Now when I use some websites I notice some interactive features or layout choices that I think are nice and how someone was able to come up with that idea and execute it. I definitely plan on continuing coding in the future whether it is work related or for fun because I think I will need to know how to at some point. I plan to make my own website portfolio page over the summer. Overall, I enjoyed the flow of the class along with the assignments. It is not a stressful class to take, yet I definitely learned and improved skills I did not have before.</p>
