<!--Introduction: What type of website is this (corporate, e-commerce, journalism, artist, blog, etc.) and what is its purpose? Examples: Does it aim to inform people about the company or organization, to advertise a product, to provide a means for online purchase, to recruit new clients/volunteers, to convince people of a particular cause? Who is the target audience? -->

<div class="s1">
<h2><i>What type of website is Zara?</i></h2>
<!--Content: Does the content contribute to the siteâ€™s purpose? Can you easily read the text? Are the images/media engaging? -->
<img src="images/display-scroll.gif" width="800px">
<br>
<br>
<p>Zara is a fashion brand that sells clothes, accessories, beauty products, and has even added a hair care product line.</p>

<h2>Overall webiste legibility</h2>
<!--Visual Appeal/UI: Is there a visual hierarchy and how does the design accomplish it? Is there consistency with colors, fonts, layouts? Are there other engaging visual elements? Are the typefaces appropriate? Does it work well on other devices? -->
<p>When I first opened the website, still and moving images take up most of the browser.</p>

<p>Depending on the color of the image, the text within the header can become quite challenging to read. (ie. 'help,' 'login,' and 'shopping bag' buttons)</p>

<h2>Interactivity & UX</h2>
<!-- Interactivity/UX: Does the homepage direct you where to go or what to do? Does the site provide easy navigation to help you find content? What are other ways you interact with this website or app? Is it an enjoyable experience overall? -->
<p>When I click to view clothes, a large image takes up the entire display and when I continue to scroll, more large images take up the screen. Initially, I am not able to view many products at once and it takes a lot of effort to scroll through all of the clothing options when viewing them piece by piece.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<br>
<p>There is a way to change the display of products on the website in which they could become like this</p> 
<br>

    <img src="images/display2.png" width="380px">
    <img src="images/display3.png" width="380px">

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h3>Menu</h3>
<br>
<p>When I clicked on 'woman,' the drop down menu was very legible. Since it is black text against a white background within a box, it is seperate from the images.</p>
<br>

<div>
<h3>help section</h3>
<p>Initially, when I clicked on the help button I was a little confused as to why I was seeing a close up of a person's face instead of an email, phone number, or chat bot</p>
</div>
<!--Recommendations: What could be improved and how?-->
