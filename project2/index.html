<h2>Overall webiste legibility</h2>
<!--Visual Appeal/UI: Is there a visual hierarchy and how does the design accomplish it? Is there consistency with colors, fonts, layouts? Are there other engaging visual elements? Are the typefaces appropriate? Does it work well on other devices? -->
<p><b>When I first opened the website, still and moving images take up most of the browser.</b></p>

<p><b>Depending on the color of the image, the text within the header can become quite challenging to read. (ie. 'help,' 'login,' and 'shopping bag' buttons)</b></p>

<h2>Interactivity & UX</h2>
<!-- Interactivity/UX: Does the homepage direct you where to go or what to do? Does the site provide easy navigation to help you find content? What are other ways you interact with this website or app? Is it an enjoyable experience overall? -->
<p>When I click to view clothes, a large image takes up the entire display and when I continue to scroll, more large images take up the screen. Initially, I am not able to view many products at once and it takes a lot of effort to scroll through all of the clothing options when viewing them piece by piece.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<br>
<p>There is a way to change the display of products on the website in which they could become like this</p>

<h3>Menu</h3>
<br>
<p>When I clicked on 'woman,' the drop down menu was very legible. Since it is black text against a white background within a box, it is seperate from the images.</p>

<h3>Help Section</h3>
<br>
<p>Initially, when I clicked on the help button I was a little confused as to why I was seeing a close up of a person's face instead of an email, phone number, or chat bot</p>

    I then read and saw the "scroll" text so I scrolled and saw the various help topics available.</p>

<h2>My opinions on the Zara Website</h2>
<p>The Zara website, in my opinion, was designed in an artistic way that feels more like I am looking through a catalog. I like and dislike this about the site because at first, it looks really cool to see all of the images when first scrolling, but then I want to browse the clothing normally and I found it challenging to get that figured out. Despite finding the menu and clicking on the type of clothing I wanted to look through, I still had trouble with viewing them because one to two items would fill the entire display, but I was able to adjust the dispaly after closely searching.</p>
